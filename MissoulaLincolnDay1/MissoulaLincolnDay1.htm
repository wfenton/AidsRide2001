The intrepid adventurers rose early on Day 0 and made our way to the
University. 
<br>
<br>
Here we are having a leisurely breakfast, waiting for opening ceremonies to
start. In them, Palotta Teamworks emphasizes the great work we are all doing,
how it can be start of big things, etc. We also learn that Dan Palotta will be
joining us on the ride, along with his father and brother-in-law.

Afterward, we file out to the bikes and get ready to go. It's cloudy and
overcast, but still comfortable. Everyone is fired up. Today's route is an 80
mile, mostly flat trek to Lincoln.

We stream out of town, just as a train goes by. We will see many, many
trains in the coming week.

Here's a nice view of the valley leaving Missoula.

Every 15 miles or so, we reach an "outpost", which is like a pit-stop. They
have food, drinks, toilets, and bike mechanics. They are manned by volunteer
crew members, and often have a party atmosphere, with themes, costumes, etc.

Here's a shot of Josh passing by along a nice straight-away. Note the sneer.

Lunch was in a clearing by the side of the road. It always consisted of some
kind of sandwich, a pasta salad, chips, and various snack foods. Oh, and 
Gatorade. Always Gatorade. We really got sick of Gatorade.

Here's a nice valley scene with Brett/Josh and a woman (ann?) we met.

80 miles later, we arrive in Lincoln, Montana. A nice little town who's most
famous ex-resident is Ted kazinski (aka the Una-bomber).

To celebrate, we walked down to a local watering hole called the Bootlegger Inn.
Unfortunately, we arrived a day too late and missed the "Nascar Parti".

They did have great food and cheap beer however.

After getting dinner in camp, it started to rain, so we called it a night. Here is
Doug relaxing in the tent. To pass the time, we played cards. Josh even showed
us how to play "Pokeroni", apparently a Cornell favorite.

Throughout the night it continued to rain, sometimes hard. We were not excited 
about the prospect of riding in the rain the next day. I don't think any of us selpt
very well.
