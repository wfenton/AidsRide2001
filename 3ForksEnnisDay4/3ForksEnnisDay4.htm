At day-break, we hit the "dusty" trail. By this time, we had the daily
routine down pretty well. Dress, port-o-potty, breakfast, read about
today's route, break down camp, check the bike, get water/gatorade,
hit the road. Sleeping on the ground was becoming less painful.

We immediately rode through some gorgeous canyons and then 
out into some rolling farmland. Bart gave us a lecture on the
benefits of the center-pivot irrigation systems. I regaled the team
with stories of my summers on my uncles' farm in South Dakota. 
Here we stop to enjoy the local flora.

Outpost 2 was at a classic general store in some small town. Now if
only the guy I handed the camera to could have framed the photo 
better. How hard is that? Thanks for including the yellow stripe on the
road. Jeez.

We ate lunch in a small town called Twin Bridges I believe. They all
blur together after a while: Tosco, Townsend, Twin Bridges...

After lunch we got into some interesting foothills. Eventually we ended up
going through the old west town of Virginia City, where I got this action
photo of Doug.

After Virginia City, we had a pretty serious climb, at the top of which 
I snapped this shot looking back down toward Virginia City.

From there, we hit the jackpot. A 7-mile long downhill that was smooth,
banked, and only mildly curved. Wow. We all were doing 45-55mph.
Awesome. Here we are at the bottom. If you look closely you see can see
the bugs in our teeth from the smiling.

A few miles down the road, we reached the town of Ennis, and stopped
for a milkshake to celebrate.

Today's camp-site was adjacent to an RV park. We set up our tents in a 
field containing some serious rocks, cactus, etc. The other bad news is
that Doug left us today, due to a wedding commitment. He took a shuttle
over to Bozeman and flew out the next day. The good news is that I had
no tentmate for the rest of the week. Woohoo! Party at my place!

Tonight we did laundry, which consisted of a bucket, a hose, some soap, 
and a fence to dry the clothes on.
