Day 3 came bright and cheery and warm. Not a cloud in the sky.
It was to be a long, hot day. Over 80 miles to 3 Forks.  
We started the day by passing the state capital and couldn't
resist the temptation to ham it up.

Jessica took the lead.

Enough fooling around. From there we headed out on a long, flat,
valley floor.

The road here was surprisingly challenging because the shoulder was
fairly narrow, they had "rumble strips" preventing easy maneuvering,
and we were constantly having to pass slower riders. 
<br>
It was in this area that we had the first of two mishaps on the trip. We were in 
a pace line, and going pretty fast. We came upon a slow rider quite quickly, and 
unfortunately there was a car in the lane next to us, so we all slammed
on the brakes. Jessica ran into my rear wheel and flipped over onto the
shoulder. She got a nice road rash, and a nasty bump on the head. We 
convinced her to hop in the van and meet us in camp. 
<br>
The rest of the day was fairly uneventful. After lunch, we got onto a long,
boring, flat stretch. At about mile 65, they routed us onto a detour to a
small town called 3Forks. When we got there, they had an outpost set 
up with kids from the town greeting us. Very cute. Here John relaxes in
front of a cafe before our last dash to camp. Across the street, Brett/Doug
are buying some wine/champagne to smuggle into camp for later that
night.

We hammered the last 12 miles or so into camp, only to find that we
were camping in a huge open area we named "The dust bowl". No trees,
no grass, just some weeds. Here we enjoy our hard-won libations and
thank Jessica for putting up our tents.

The view was quite enjoyable however, and the night was clear and
warm.
