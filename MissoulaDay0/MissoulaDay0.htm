The plan was to meet in Missoula, and then register together
to make sure we got tent assignments, etc.

Here we are meeting up with John in the Seattle airport.

From there, we took a turbo-prop plane to Missoula.

We quickly observed that this state has an obsession with 
stuffed animals, as evidenced by this bear in the airport.

Our theory was confirmed when we got to the hotel, and noticed
they were also hosting the "Montana state knife show and exposition".
They should change the state motto to "You kill it, we'll skin it".
We tore ourselves away from the knife show and went over to the nearby
university to check in for the ride.

After dealing with last-minute donations, viewing the safety propoganda
film, and getting our tent assignments arranged, checking our bikes, we hooked up with Eric,
who was being briefed on his Crew duties. We also hooked up Brett's friend Josh,
from Washington DC.

We went back to the hotel room to deal with our gear.

We then got a nice meal and went to bed early, as we had to be on the
shuttle to the university at 5 am. Missoula seemed like a nice town, and 
in fact was named by Outdoor magazine as one of the top 10 towns in 
America to live.
