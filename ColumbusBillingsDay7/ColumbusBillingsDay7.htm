Once again, the skies cleared over night, and the morning was great.
Here Bart dawdles a bit too slowly and Brett/John break down the tent
around him.

We decide to leave as late as possible today, because in Billings, we'll
have to wait around for closing ceremonies anyway. On the road out 
of Columbus, we run into some nasty rolling hills, that make for a nasty
traffic jam. We pass a couple of hundred riders, and then I catch a 
shot of Bart right before a downhill. Pretty good shot for a disposable, eh?

We gott to the top of the hills and reached Outpost 1, which was even more
festive than usual, this being day 7. Disco music blaring, dancing, the
whole bit.

The rest of the day was fairly uneventful. Mostly flat and mildly rolling,
mostly farmland, not as scenic. We rolled into Billings around 1pm. 
Of course, our first thought was FOOD! We walked around and found a
Pizza Hut. Praise Jesus. Only it was packed. And they didn't serve beer.
No matter. We helped clear tables. And Brett/Josh went down the street
and picked up some beer and brought it back. Once again, the photo didn't
come out, but I had to include it for posterity.

We then went back and helped cheer on the final riders as they came in.
Then we took this photo by the finish area. Note the bulging thighs on our
lean, mean, fighting machine. Well, maybe not.

At around 3pm, we got into line and rode down toward the closing ceremony
area. Then we waited, and waited, and waited.

Finally we road into the ceremony area, which was in a park. Music was
blaring, wild cheering, etc.

More wildness.

There were some riders who spoke about the importance of what we
were doing. Some reps from the beneficiary AIDS research institutes
thanked us for our support. Dan Palotta talked for a while his mission
to spread this kind of activism around the country and the world. Overall,
it was a nice ceremony. I didn't cry too much, which was good. 
<br><br>
I really did feel like we all accomplished something pretty special, and
that we all could be proud. Not just our group from Latitude, but all 1025
riders and 250 crew members. It was a pretty amazing effort by everyone,
riding around 540 miles over 7 days, camping each night in some varied conditions, and
all the while being friendly and helpful to everyone. Not to mention what a great
cause we were supporting. I'd love to do something like that again some day.

After that we put our bikes on the shipping truck and headed back to the
hotel. Here's our final photo as we pick up our gear and get ready to go
to the hotel. Thanks everyone!!
