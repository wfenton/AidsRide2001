After leaving Ennis, we warmed up with a long flat section. Then we hit
a substantial hill. Here's a view from the top looking back into the
valley where Ennis was. Each one of these looked like it could fit the
entire bay area without any problem. Huge.

From there, another awesome downhill, followed by a roller coaster 
series of hills through a breathtaking canyon. Here we are at the bottom.

Farther along, another photo op. In the water, I saw a beaver swimming
by. This, combined with the numerous stuffed specimens we encountered, 
allowed us to use the "nice beaver" joke no fewer than 5 times on the trip!

Below, they had a a great Outpost along the snake river, I believe. By this
time, whenever we passed someone, we would say "On your left, team pain
train. All aboard". Other options included "kung pao chicken on your left", etc.
You can imagine how boring it got sometimes.

We then moved into a nice area of rolling hills and wheat fields. This seemed 
like the definition of the "Amber waves of grain" in the song.

The rest of the ride was fairly uneventful, although we had to ride a nasty
bit on Interstate 90, with trucks wizzing by. Really sucked. Later we got onto
a frontage road, that had some nice downhills. We arrived in the town of 
Livingston, which was very cute, but as we were to find out, also very windy. 
We took a welcome dip in the nearby swimming pool, and got back to camp just as 
the wind kicked up.

Look closely. In this photo, there is now the frame of a 20x30ft tent
that wasn't there before. It flew off it's stakes and into a powerline! Ouch.

They immediately evacuated us into the adjecent gym.

We decided that would be a waste of time, and went into town. Here we
are at a local chinese restaurant, that was actually pretty good. They were
woefully understaffed, so everyone was helping clear dishes, etc.

After dinner, we got into the second "scrape" of the trip. Our trusty crew member,
Eric, had access to a radio and a van. He had heard that the wind died down and
they were letting people go back to their tents. We jumped in the van, and he
pulled out a little too close to this truck.

This was big news for Livingston. We had a cop, the fire dept, Palotta reps, etc.
After standing around for a while, we just got a bunch of guys from the restaurant 
and lifted the rear end of the van away from the truck. Pretty minimal damage.
