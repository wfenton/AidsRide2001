In the morning, it was still raining, as you can see below. We heard later that
Dan Palotta was spending the entire trip in an RV, and not out in the tents 
with the rest of the riff-raff. What's up with that? I guess I'd do the same if I
were him.

We took it easy and headed over for a leisurely breakfast. There we 
heard that it was too wet/windy up on the pass to allow us through, 
so they prevented anyone from starting for an hour so. So we waited,
but finally were forced to pack up and get going, despite the rain. Note
the bitterness you can see in Brett's face.Today's route was the 
shortest, (60 miles or so), but also supposed to be one of the hilliest, with
a peak of 6300 ft, where we were to cross the continental divide at Flescher Pass.

As we rode that morning, it sprinkled on and off. At least it was relatively
warm. Here we stop at a scenic turnout and display the popular bikes-in-the-air
pose.

The climb up to Flescher Pass was pretty reasonable, and not too difficult
for those of us from Northern California. The only problem was that we
were at a higher altitude, but we were fairly acclimitized by now anyway. When 
we reached the pass, it was still raining, and now it was quite
cold. Everyone wanted to get the hell out of there, particularly when we
heard it was clearing down below.

Here's me pretending to be happy. Everything was soaked. Some of us grabbed
Mylar sheets to wrap our feet, head, body, etc. It helped quite a bit.

We then started a steep descent, which was difficult because it was 
raining, and also because our hands were so cold it made it harder to
control the brakes. On the plus side, the rain stopped after a few miles.
Here you can see me in front of the big valley, and you can see it's starting
to clear up.

After riding through some foothills, we arrived at our lunch stop, Montana Al's,
bar and grill. We had our usual fare in the dirt parking lot, and then a bunch
of us went in to get some coffee and warm up.

From there, our luck turned. The sun came out, it warmed up, and we arrived
in Helena. We quickly pitched our tents and put everything out to dry. Here's
John relaxing.

Behind Doug and Jessica you can see a local college I believe.

It was still quite breezy, and as a result our tents were getting blown about.
John fashioned a rope support in an attempt to steady the poles on his tent. 
While not the most effective device, it did provide much needed entertainment.

We showered, and then went into town. We found a cute place called 
Bert and Ernies. Dinner and beers for seven: $70, including tip. Amazing.

We walked around the downtown area, and came across a shakespeare
company performing what appeared to be a Japanese interpretation of Othello.
Interesting.
