Day 6 started quite inauspiciously. Bart had a problem with his
tire and couldn't get the right replacement from the bike mechanics.
He got a substitute on OK, but then at the outskirts of town, it blew
out again. Ouch. We decided to take it easy that day. But it was not
to be. We got onto a 30 mile flat stretch with a tailwind. We got
into a groove in the paceline and hammered at 25-30mph for a couple
of hours. It was great.

We had lunch by the side of a river, so everyone went down and ate
by the water.

Here the guys get as wet as we can without soaking the bike
shorts.

At Outpost 3, the crew set up "A Day at the Spa" complete with
wading pool. A great way to socialize and cool off the feet at the
same time.

We then hit a little more freeway, but not so bad. Then we 
got back onto a frontage road, and headed toward our goal, which
was Columbus. Here we are in front of some more great scenery.

OK, so we headed into town, and decided that it was early so we should
stop off somewhere for a beverage. We found an interesting looking
bar, we walked in, and, Whoa! It's the bar of death! There's stuffed 
animals everywhere! This photo didn't come out well, but I included it
just so you could see a glimpse of it. They had elk, deer, eagle, a wolf, 
two bobcats fighting, a two-headed calf, and yes, a  beaver. The bar 
was great too. They had real spitoons built into it. Piano. Everything. 
It was hilarious.

That night, they had a talent show, which was pretty good, until the 
wind kicked up again, and the main tent started to strain against the 
stakes.

Once again, everyone is evacuated to the gym. Once again,
we say no thanks, and headed downtown. We hung out for a while in 
the BOD, walk around for a while, and then went back to camp.

OK, so we got to sleep, and then around midnight, BOOM! Lightning and hard rain.
It was a couple of miles off, but still pretty scary, and of course they
evacuated everyone into the gym. Some of us brought our sleeping bags and
slept on the gym floor. The rest of us just slept through it, which is just as
well, since it stopped about 10 minutes later.
